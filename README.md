## Summary
By removing the Freshmen class of Thomas High School, neither the District nor the school itself suffered in their overall scores for Matt and Reading.  

There does not appear to be any direct correlation to the higher budget per student and the percentage of the student population passing both math and reading. In fact, the percentage of students passing both math and reading for the range of $645-675 (the highest range) was only 54%. 

Using the school size, the larger the school did result in a lower overall passing percentage with 58%.  

It does appear that Charter schools do significantly better (at least 15% or more) in the percentage of their student population that passes Math and Reading.  Although the average scores are within 10 points.
